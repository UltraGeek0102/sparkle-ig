## What is Sparkle?

Sparkle is a [Theos](https://theos.dev) tweak that reshapes the iOS Instagram app around you. Download any media, keep a private on-device gallery, recover deleted messages, run each account with its own settings, analyze your followers, and strip out the ads, AI, and annoyances.

It started as a fork of [SoCuul's SCInsta](https://github.com/SoCuul/SCInsta), but has since been rewritten and extended far beyond it.

- Targets **iOS 15.0+**, built with the iOS 16.2 SDK.
- Works **jailbroken** (tested via Dopamine on iOS 16.7.16) and **sideloaded** (Feather, SideStore, LiveContainer etc.).
- Written in Objective-C / Objective-C++ / Logos.

## Highlights

For the full list of features, check out [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

- **Media downloads**:
  - Save feed posts, reels, stories, DMs, Instants, and comments.
  - Auto-save stories, view-once DM media, and instants straight to the Gallery or Photos as you view them.
  - An action-based download manager with a queue, retries, duplicate detection, and configurable concurrency.
  - High-quality DASH video+audio merging via FFmpegKit.
- **Private Gallery**:
  - An on-device media library with folders, search, metadata, source overlays, and an optional passcode / Face ID / Touch ID lock. Nothing ever leaves your device.
  - Import your own media from Files with editable metadata, or bring your whole Regram Media Vault over in one go.
  - Browse saved Instants by user straight from the Instants camera.
  - Send any photo or video you already have as an Instant, from Photos, Files, or the Gallery.
- **Built-in editors**:
  - Trim any video down to a clip, a single still frame, or audio-only.
  - Crop, pan/zoom, rotate, and flip a video's framing, applied in the same pass as the trim.
  - A photo editor with crop / pan-zoom / rotate / flip.
  - Reachable from the gallery, media preview, or an opt-in action button.
- **Action buttons everywhere**:
  - Fully customizable action-button menus on feed, reels, stories, DMs, Instants, and profiles.
  - Reorder, rename, re-icon, and set per-surface default tap actions.
  - An optional feed-header shortcut button for one-tap access to Gallery, Profile Analyzer, Deleted Messages, Downloads or Settings.
- **Keep deleted messages**:
  - Preserve unsent DMs, log removed reactions, and recover view-once media, with a browsable log.
- **Profile Analyzer**:
  - Fetches your followers/following and surfaces mutuals, non-followbacks, and a durable change log (new/lost followers, profile updates) across scans.
- **Per-account settings**:
  - Each logged-in account keeps its own preferences, gallery scope, and download history.
- **Privacy & focus**:
  - Hide ads, Meta AI, and suggested content.
  - Disable seen receipts, typing status, screenshot detection, and view-once limits.
  - Block doom-scrolling.
  - Hide tabs and UI clutter.
- **Confirmations**:
  - Optional "are you sure?" guards for accidental likes, follows, reposts, calls, comments, and more.
- **Liquid Glass (iOS 26+)**:
  - Native Liquid Glass integration across Sparkle's own UI, plus an option to force-enable Instagram's.
  - On iOS 18 and lower, a **Pill-Shaped Tab Bar** toggle brings the floating pill tab bar (shape only; the glass material stays iOS 26+).

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sparkle does **not** ship Instagram itself. Pre-injected IPAs are distributed on the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/sparkle_ig), and the jailbroken `.deb` is on [Releases](https://github.com/efibalogh/sparkle-ig/releases/latest) or from the [Sparkle repo](https://efibalogh.github.io/sparkle-ig/).

### Sideloaded

1. Grab the latest **pre-injected IPA** from the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/sparkle_ig).
2. Install the IPA with your sideloading tool of choice.
   - Use the **`_sidestore`** build for **AltStore / SideStore / LiveContainer** (or if you don't want to have app extensions).

> [!NOTE]
> Sparkle uses Instagram's bundled image assets everywhere. The distributed IPA is a full (un-thinned) build (it contains icons for all screen sizes), so the higher-quality in-app icons render crisply on every device. If you build your own from an IPA that was already thinned to a smaller device, some icon scales may be missing. See [Building from source](#building-from-source).

### Jailbroken

Add the Sparkle repo to your package manager and you will get updates as they ship.

<div align="left">

[![Add the Sparkle repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%A6%20Add%20the%20Sparkle%20Repo-ED1E9C?style=for-the-badge)](https://efibalogh.github.io/sparkle-ig/)

</div>

Open that page on your device and tap Sileo or Zebra,
or add the URL by hand:

```
https://efibalogh.github.io/sparkle-ig/
```

The repo serves both the rootless (`iphoneos-arm64`) and rootful (`iphoneos-arm`) builds; your
package manager picks the right one for your jailbreak automatically.

Rather not add a repo? Install a single `.deb` instead, and update it yourself each release:

1. Download the rootless or rootful `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/efibalogh/sparkle-ig/releases/latest).
2. Open the `.deb` in Sileo/Zebra (or install it with `dpkg -i` over SSH), then respring.

### Build it yourself

You can build from source locally, or fork the repo and run the **Build and Package Sparkle** GitHub Action with your own decrypted IPA URL. The injected IPA lands as a draft release in *your* fork. See [Building from source](#building-from-source).

## Opening Sparkle Settings

By default, **long-press the Home tab** or the **Profile settings button** to open Sparkle Settings. You can also enable *Show Settings on App Launch*. If you hide the Home tab, the long-press automatically moves to another visible tab so Settings is always reachable.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode** + Command-Line Developer Tools
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [Theos](https://theos.dev/docs/installation) with the **iPhoneOS16.2.sdk** in `~/theos/sdks`
- `brew install ldid dpkg make cmake` (plus the FFmpeg build deps: `autoconf automake libtool meson nasm ninja pkgconf wget yasm`)
- **For sideloading only:** [cyan](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw#install-instructions) and [ipapatch](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/ipapatch/releases/latest)

### Setup

1. **Install the iOS 16.2 SDK** for Theos — download from [xybp888/iOS-SDKs](https://github.com/xybp888/iOS-SDKs) and copy `iPhoneOS16.2.sdk` into `~/theos/sdks`.
2. **Clone with submodules:**
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/efibalogh/sparkle-ig
   cd sparkle-ig
   ```
3. **Fetch the FFmpegKit frameworks** (used for video/audio merging & trimming):
   ```sh
   ./fetch-ffmpegkit.sh
   ```
4. **For sideloading:** obtain a **decrypted, un-thinned** Instagram IPA from a trusted source, rename it to `com.burbn.instagram.ipa`, and place it in a `packages/` folder at the repo root.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a *universal* decrypted IPA. An IPA that was already thinned to a specific device (e.g. dumped on an older iPhone) might be missing higher-scale icons/image assets, which makes icons and image assets blurry on newer devices.
>
> Alternatively, if you own a jailbroken device, I recommend using [ipadecrypt](https://github.com/londek/ipadecrypt), which provides an un-thinned IPA regardless of your device's screen size.

### Build

```sh
./build.sh rootless          # rootless .deb (jailbroken)
./build.sh rootful           # rootful .deb (jailbroken)
./build.sh ipa --release     # sideload IPA (= --inject --ffmpeg --patch)
```

The `ipa` command takes composable flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--release` | Shorthand for `--inject --ffmpeg --patch` |
| `--inject` | Inject `Sparkle.dylib` |
| `--ffmpeg` | Bundle the FFmpegKit frameworks |
| `--flex` | Bundle `libFLEX.dylib` (in-app debugging) |
| `--patch` | Run `ipapatch` |
| `--no-ext` | Strip all `.appex` bundles before injection |
| `--sidestore` | Shorthand for `--release --no-ext` (for SideStore) |
| `--dev` | `DEV=1` build (also enables the developer diagnostics: performance meter and hook bisect, under Settings → Tools → Diagnostics) |
| `--buildonly` | Build dylibs only, skip IPA packaging |
| `--bundle-id <id>` | Override the bundle ID |

Outputs are named with the Sparkle version (and, for IPAs, the bundled Instagram version) so builds are easy to tell apart:

- **IPA**: `Sparkle[_<flags>]_v<version>_IG_v<ig version>.ipa` (e.g. `Sparkle_v1.0.0_IG_v437.2.0.ipa`, or `Sparkle_no-flex_v1.0.0_IG_v437.2.0.ipa`)
- **deb**: `Sparkle_v<version>_<rootless|rootful>.deb`

Run `./build.sh` with no arguments for the full usage reference.

### Recompiling the Liquid Glass app icons

The app icons are pre-compiled into `resources/sparkle_icons/` to keep IPA packaging fast. If you change the source `.icon` bundles in `resources/`, recompile them with `actool` before building:

```zsh
mkdir -p resources/compiled_sparkle resources/compiled_sparkle_dark resources/compiled_sparkle_neutral

xcrun actool resources/sparkle.icon         --compile resources/compiled_sparkle         --platform iphoneos --minimum-deployment-target 15.0 --app-icon sparkle         --output-partial-info-plist resources/sparkle_partial.plist         --target-device iphone --target-device ipad
xcrun actool resources/sparkle-dark.icon    --compile resources/compiled_sparkle_dark    --platform iphoneos --minimum-deployment-target 15.0 --app-icon sparkle-dark    --output-partial-info-plist resources/sparkle_dark_partial.plist    --target-device iphone --target-device ipad
xcrun actool resources/sparkle-neutral.icon --compile resources/compiled_sparkle_neutral --platform iphoneos --minimum-deployment-target 15.0 --app-icon sparkle-neutral --output-partial-info-plist resources/sparkle_neutral_partial.plist --target-device iphone --target-device ipad

mkdir -p resources/sparkle_icons
cp resources/compiled_sparkle/*.png resources/compiled_sparkle_dark/*.png resources/compiled_sparkle_neutral/*.png resources/sparkle_icons/
rm -rf resources/compiled_sparkle resources/compiled_sparkle_dark resources/compiled_sparkle_neutral resources/*_partial.plist
```

## Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated! Feel free to open a pull request.

- New hooked IG classes/methods go in `src/InstagramHeaders.h`
- Prefix all custom symbols with `spk_` / `SPK`.
- Break new features into `src/Features/<Surface>/` rather than bloating `Tweak.x`.

Not a coder? Documentation improvements are always appreciated too.

## Official builds

Sparkle is free and always will be. It is only distributed here and on the official [Telegram channel](https://t.me/sparkle_ig). There is no paid version, no subscription, and no store that sells it.

Sparkle is licensed under the GPL-3.0. Anyone may modify it and even charge for it, but only if they give their users the complete source of their build and keep the original license and attribution intact.

[**SKInstagram**](https://t.me/ikurdstore/4799?embed=1) (backup links in case the post gets deleted: [link 1](https://archive.ph/znSIh), [link 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20260808011714/https://t.me/ikurdstore/4799?embed=1)), credited to the "SideKit team" and distributed through the iKURD Store, appears to be built from Sparkle and is offered behind that store's paid subscription. It ships no source and no attribution, which means it is not licensed to be distributed at all. If you paid for it, you were charged for free software that you can get here for nothing.
